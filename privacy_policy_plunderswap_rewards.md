# Privacy Policy – Plunderswap Rewards

**Last updated:** 2026-01-12

This Privacy Policy explains how **Plunderswap Rewards** (the “App”) handles information when you use it. The App is published by **Noroe Tech** (“we”, “us”).

## Summary
- The App does **not** require you to create an account.
- The App does **not** collect your name, email address, phone number, precise location, contacts, photos, or messages.
- The App may process your **public wallet address** to display your balances, staking positions, and rewards.
- The App does **not** sell personal data and does **not** use data for advertising.

## Information the App may process

### Public wallet address (User ID / identifier)
If you connect a wallet using WalletConnect, the App may process your **public wallet address** to retrieve and display blockchain-related information such as balances, staking positions, and rewards.

- **Purpose:** App functionality (showing your portfolio/staking data)
- **Storage:** The App may store your selected wallet address and related display preferences **locally on your device** to provide a smoother experience. We do not operate a user account system for the App.

### On-chain / public blockchain data
Blockchain data is public by nature. When you use the App, it may request information from blockchain nodes and public endpoints in order to display on-chain data.

### Network information
When the App connects to third-party services (such as WalletConnect relay servers, blockchain RPC endpoints, or public price/data APIs), those services may receive standard network information such as your **IP address** and device/network metadata as part of normal internet communication. We do not run our own servers to collect this information.

## What we do **not** collect
We do **not** collect:
- Name, email address, phone number, physical address
- Precise or approximate location
- Contacts
- Photos, videos, audio recordings
- SMS/MMS or other message content
- Installed apps
- Payment card/bank details or purchase history within the App
- Advertising identifiers

## Sharing of data
We do not sell your data. The App does not share data with third parties for advertising or marketing.

However, to function, the App may communicate with third-party service providers (e.g., WalletConnect relay infrastructure, blockchain RPC providers, and public data/price APIs). These providers may receive your **public wallet address** and standard network information as needed to return the requested data.

## Security
We use standard secure network transport (e.g., HTTPS / encrypted connections where available). No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, but we aim to use reasonable safeguards.

## Data retention and deletion
We do not maintain user accounts. Any locally stored app data can be removed by:
- disconnecting your wallet (if available in the App), and/or
- clearing the App’s storage in your device settings, and/or
- uninstalling the App.

## Children’s privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect changes.
