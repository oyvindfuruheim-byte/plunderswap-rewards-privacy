      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account.</li>
        <li>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email address, phone number, precise location, contacts, photos, or messages.</li>
        <li>The App may process your <strong>public wallet address</strong> to display balances, staking positions, and rewards.</li>
        <li>The App does <strong>not</strong> sell personal data and does <strong>not</strong> use data for advertising.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Information the App may process</h2>

    <h2>Public wallet address (User ID / identifier)</h2>
    <p>If you connect a wallet using WalletConnect, the App may process your <strong>public wallet address</strong> to retrieve and display blockchain-related information such as balances, staking positions, and rewards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> App functionality (showing your portfolio/staking data)</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The App may store your selected wallet address and related display preferences <strong>locally on your device</strong> to provide a smoother experience. We do not operate a user account system for the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>On-chain / public blockchain data</h2>
    <p>Blockchain data is public by nature. When you use the App, it may request information from blockchain nodes and public endpoints in order to display on-chain data.</p>

    <h2>Network information</h2>
    <p>When the App connects to third-party services (such as WalletConnect relay servers, blockchain RPC endpoints, or public price/data APIs), those services may receive standard network information such as your <strong>IP address</strong> and device/network metadata as part of normal internet communication. We do not run our own servers to collect this information.</p>

    <h2>What we do not collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address, phone number, physical address</li>
      <li>Precise or approximate location</li>
      <li>Contacts</li>
      <li>Photos, videos, audio recordings</li>
      <li>SMS/MMS or other message content</li>
      <li>Installed apps</li>
      <li>Payment card/bank details or purchase history within the App</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. The App does not share data with third parties for advertising or marketing.</p>
    <p>However, to function, the App may communicate with third-party service providers (e.g., WalletConnect relay infrastructure, blockchain RPC providers, and public data/price APIs). These providers may receive your <strong>public wallet address</strong> and standard network information as needed to return the requested data.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use standard secure network transport (e.g., HTTPS / encrypted connections where available). No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, but we aim to use reasonable safeguards.</p>

    <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>We do not maintain user accounts. Any locally stored app data can be removed by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>disconnecting your wallet (if available in the App), and/or</li>
      <li>clearing the App’s storage in your device settings, and/or</li>
      <li>uninstalling the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
